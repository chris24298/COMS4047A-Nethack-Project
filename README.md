We attempt to solve the [NetHack] environment through the application of reinforcement learning methods listed below.

# Value Function method
- Deep Q-network

# Policy Gradient method
- Actor-Critic

# Code
Both methods were designed to be run on Google Colab and are therefore in a Jupyter notebook format. The code can be executed directly on Google Colab. If the code is to be executed on a dedicated machine note that the NetHack environment and its requiremnents must be setup correctly. Further instructions can be found in the official [NetHack] repository.
